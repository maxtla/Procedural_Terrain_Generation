## Procedural Terrain Generation with DirectX 12

**Author:** Max Tlatlik

**Supervisor:** Stefan Petersson

This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis and explores the topic of procedural terrain generation. 
Specifically it aims to implement and examine an algorithm for procedural terrain generation on the GPU 
with the modern graphics API DirectX 12. The algorithm for procedural terrain generation is based on the
previous work done in the book *GPU Gems 3*, Chapter 1, by Hubert Nguyen. I will examine the performance and 
memory consumption of the algorithm for all the 3 different block generation methods as described in the book.

The framework is build using SDL 2.0 for window and event management, logging, and with DirectX 12 as the custom renderer.
ImGui is added for simple and easy UI management.
